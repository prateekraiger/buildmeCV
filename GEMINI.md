  - `src/constants.ts`: Emptied to remove old color constants, as new color variables are now defined in `index.css`.
  - `src/components/blocks/hero-section-1.tsx`: 
    - Removed `mt-2` from the navbar to position it at the top.
    - Removed the background grid and radial gradient to use the global background.
    - Changed `next/link` to `react-router-dom` Link.

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Installed new npm packages: `lucide-react`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `framer-motion`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, and `tailwindcss-animate` using `pnpm`.
  - Downgraded `lucide-react` to `^0.408.0`.

- **File Deletions:**
  - `src/components/Layout.tsx`: Deleted the old Layout component.
