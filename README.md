## üé® Customization

Customizing the look and feel of BuildMeCV is straightforward.

### Changing the Color Palette

All colors are defined as CSS variables and configured within Tailwind CSS in the `index.html` file.

1.  Open `index.html`.
2.  Locate the `<script>` tag containing `tailwind.config`.
3.  You can change the hex codes for the following color variables:
    -   `primary`: The main dark background color.
    -   `secondary`: The lighter blue/gray for secondary text and elements.
    -   `accent`: The main highlight color for buttons, links, and titles.
    -   `accent-dark`: A darker version of the accent for hover states.
    -   `text-light`: The primary light text color.
    -   `background-light`: The background color for the resume preview and PDF.

```html
<script>
  tailwind.config = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
        colors: {
          'primary': 'var(--color-primary, #003049)',
          'secondary': 'var(--color-secondary, #669bbc)',
          'accent': 'var(--color-accent, #c1121f)',
          /* ... more colors */
        },
      },
    },
  };
</script>
```

### Changing Accent Color Options

The preset accent color choices available in the builder can be modified in `components/builder/design/AccentColorPicker.tsx`. Simply update the `colors` array with your desired `name` and hex `value`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

This project is designed to run directly in the browser without a complex build step. For the best experience, especially for features like importing/exporting data, it's recommended to serve the files using a local web server.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- [Node.js and pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed on your system.
- A Google Gemini API Key for AI features.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **API Key Configuration:**
    The AI enhancement feature requires a Google Gemini API key. The application is coded to read this key from `process.env.API_KEY`. You must ensure this environment variable is set in the execution context where you are serving the application. **Do not hard-code your API key in the source code.**

3.  **Running the Application with a Local Server:**
    Using a local server is the recommended way to run the application. We'll use `http-server`, which you can run easily with `pnpm`.

    ```bash
    # Run a local server on port 8080
    pnpm exec http-server .
    ```
    
    If you don't have `http-server`, `pnpm exec` will prompt you to install it. Once running, open your browser and navigate to the address provided (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

You can now start building your resume!
