## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

This project is designed to run directly in the browser without a complex build step. For the best experience, especially for features like importing/exporting data, it's recommended to serve the files using a local web server.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prateekraiger/buildmeCV.git
    cd buildmeCV
    ```

2.  **API Key Configuration:**
    The AI enhancement feature requires a Google Gemini API key. The application is coded to read this key from `process.env.API_KEY`. You must ensure this environment variable is set in the execution context where you are serving the application. **Do not hard-code your API key in the source code.**

3.  **Running the Application with a Local Server:**
    Using a local server is the recommended way to run the application. We'll use `http-server`, which you can run easily with `pnpm`.

    ```bash
    # Run a local server on port 8080
    pnpm exec http-server .
    ```

    If you don't have `http-server`, `pnpm exec` will prompt you to install it. Once running, open your browser and navigate to the address provided (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

You can now start building your resume!
